**A. Multiplication Table using 'for' loop.**                                                                                                                                                                            
The program takes a number and a limit as input and then prints the multiplication table for that number up to the given limit.                                                                                      
Algorithm :

1. Create integer variables 'number', 'limit', and 'multiplier' to store user inputs.
2. Display "Enter the number - ".
3. Read and store the entered number in the 'number' variable.
4. Display "Enter limit - ".
5. Read and store the entered limit in the 'limit' variable.
6. Use a 'for' loop with 'multiplier' ranging from 1 to 'limit' (inclusive):
   a. Inside the loop, display the result of the multiplication in the format "number * multiplier = result".
      - Calculate the result as 'number * multiplier'.
      - Print this line.
7. End of the program.
